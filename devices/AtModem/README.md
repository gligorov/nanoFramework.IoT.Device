# Sim7080G - Dual Mode Wireless Module CatM

The 'Sim7080' supports both 'CAT-M' and 'NB-IoT'. It can be controlled through AT command via a Serial/UART interface.

> Note: The module is tested on a Sim7080 but is also compatible with Sim7070 and Sim7090.

## Documentation

[Datasheet](https://m5stack.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/resource/docs/datasheet/unit/sim7080g/en/Sim7080_Series_SPEC_20200427.pdf) for the Sim7080G.

## Usage

**Important**: make sure you properly setup the RT/RX pins especially for ESP32 before creating the `SerialPort`, make sure you install the `nanoFramework.Hardware.ESP32 nuget`:

```csharp
static SerialPort _serialPort;
static Sim7080G _sim;

private static void OpenSerialPort(
    string port = "COM3",
    int baudRate = 115200,
    Parity parity = Parity.None,
    StopBits stopBits = StopBits.One,
    Handshake handshake = Handshake.XOnXOff,
    int dataBits = 8,
    char watchChar = '\r')
{
    //In this example configure GPIOs 16 and 17 to be used in UART2 (that's refered as COM3)
    Configuration.SetPinFunction(16, DeviceFunction.COM3_RX);
    Configuration.SetPinFunction(17, DeviceFunction.COM3_TX);

    _serialPort = new(port)
    {
        //Set parameters
        BaudRate = baudRate,
        Parity = parity,
        StopBits = stopBits,
        Handshake = handshake,
        DataBits = dataBits,
    };

    try
    {
        //Open the serial port
        _serialPort.Open();
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine(exception.Message);
    }

    //Set a watch char to be notified when it's available in the input stream
    _serialPort.WatchChar = watchChar;
}
```

Create an EventHandler to handle the `AT Command Acknowledge messages` received via the `SerialPort`:

```csharp

_serialPort.DataReceived += SerialDevice_DataReceived;

private static void SerialDevice_DataReceived(object sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e)
{
    _sim.ReadResponse();
}
```

Initiate the module by passing in the `SerialPort` instance into the constructor:

```csharp
 _sim = new Sim7080G(_serialPort);
```

An example on how to use this device binding is available in the [samples](samples) folder.
